        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a passionate web developer with a love for crafting clean, efficient code and creating engaging user experiences. With 5+ years of experience in web development, I've had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects, from simple landing pages to complex web applications.</p>
            <p>My journey in web development began with a curiosity to understand how websites work. Since then, I've delved deep into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, constantly expanding my skill set and staying updated with the latest technologies and trends in the industry.</p>
            <p>What excites me most about web development is the endless opportunity for creativity and problem-solving. Whether I'm designing a responsive layout, optimizing site performance, or implementing new features, I approach each task with enthusiasm and attention to detail.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or seeking inspiration in the world around me. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy exchanging ideas with fellow developers to learn and grow together.</p>
            <p>I'm currently  seeking employment. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate on a project or just say hello!</p>
